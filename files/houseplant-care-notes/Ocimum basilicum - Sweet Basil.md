# Ocimum basilicum - Sweet Basil

## Water

Water the Sweet Basil plant regularly, keeping the soil consistently moist but not waterlogged. Allow the top inch of soil to dry out slightly before watering again. Be careful not to overwater, as it can lead to root rot. During hot weather or in dry indoor environments, you may need to water more frequently.

## Sun

Sweet Basil plants require ample sunlight to thrive. Place them in a location that receives at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight each day. If growing indoors, provide them with bright, indirect light or use grow lights to supplement the natural light. Insufficient sunlight can result in leggy growth and reduced flavor.

## Soil

Plant Sweet Basil in well-draining soil that is rich in organic matter. A soil pH of 6.0 to 7.5 is ideal. You can amend the soil with compost or well-rotted manure to improve its fertility and drainage. Avoid compacted or heavy clay soils, as they can hinder root development.

## Fertilizer

Feed Sweet Basil with a balanced, water-soluble fertilizer every 2-3 weeks during the active growing season (spring and summer). Use a fertilizer specifically formulated for herbs or vegetables. Follow the package instructions for the correct dosage. Avoid over-fertilization, as it can lead to excessive foliage growth and diminished flavor.

## Pruning

Regular pruning is essential for Sweet Basil plants to promote bushier growth and prevent flowering. Pinch off the top pair of leaves on each stem to encourage branching. Harvest the leaves frequently, which also helps keep the plant compact. Pruning should be done throughout the growing season.

## Harvesting

Harvest Sweet Basil leaves once the plant has developed enough foliage. You can begin harvesting once the plant has reached a height of 6-8 inches. Take care not to remove more than one-third of the plant at a time. Harvest leaves from the top, just above a pair of leaves or branching point.

## Pests and Diseases

Sweet Basil can be susceptible to pests such as aphids, whiteflies, and spider mites. Regularly inspect the plant for any signs of infestation and take appropriate measures, such as using insecticidal soap or neem oil, to control the pests. Ensure good air circulation around the plant to prevent fungal diseases like powdery mildew.

## Companion Plants

Sweet Basil benefits from being planted alongside certain companion plants, such as tomatoes, peppers, and marigolds. These plants can help repel pests and enhance the growth and flavor of the basil. However, avoid planting Sweet Basil near other herbs such as rue or sage, as they may inhibit its growth.

## Misc

Sweet Basil is a popular culinary herb known for its aromatic leaves and distinctive flavor, which is commonly used in Italian and Mediterranean cuisines. It is an annual plant that can be grown both indoors and outdoors. Regular harvesting and pruning will help promote a healthier and more productive plant.

# Peperomia Obtusifolia - Crocodile Tears

## Water

Water the Crocodile Tears plant when the top inch of soil feels dry. These plants prefer slightly moist but not waterlogged soil. Ensure good drainage to prevent root rot. Avoid overwatering, as it can cause issues such as yellowing leaves or wilting. During winter or dormancy periods, reduce watering frequency.

## Sun

Crocodile Tears plants thrive in bright, indirect sunlight. Place them near a window with filtered light or in a location with partial shade. They can tolerate lower light conditions but may not thrive in full shade. Avoid exposing them to direct sunlight for extended periods, as it can scorch the leaves.

## Spray

Crocodile Tears plants do not require regular spraying. They prefer average to slightly higher humidity levels, but misting is generally not necessary. However, in dry indoor environments, occasional misting can help increase humidity and prevent the leaf edges from drying out.

## Prune

Pruning the Crocodile Tears plant is typically not necessary unless you want to shape or remove any leggy or damaged parts. Trim off any dead or yellowing leaves close to the stem using clean pruning shears. Pruning can be done at any time of the year as needed.

## Food

Crocodile Tears plants have low fertilizer requirements. Feed them with a balanced, water-soluble fertilizer diluted to half the recommended strength. Apply the fertilizer every 2-3 months during the growing season (spring and summer). Avoid fertilizing during winter or dormancy periods.

## Propagation

Crocodile Tears plants can be propagated from stem cuttings. Take a healthy stem cutting with a few leaves, remove the lower leaves, and place the cutting in a container with well-draining soil. Keep the soil slightly moist and provide indirect light and warmth. Roots should develop within a few weeks.

## Safety

Crocodile Tears plants are generally safe and non-toxic to humans and pets. However, ingestion may still cause mild stomach discomfort. It is always best to keep any plant out of reach of children and pets.

## Common Problems

Overwatering is a common issue with Crocodile Tears plants, leading to root rot. Ensure the soil has good drainage and avoid excessive moisture. These plants are generally pest-resistant but may occasionally attract mealybugs or spider mites. Regularly inspect the leaves for signs of pests and take appropriate measures if necessary.

## Misc

Crocodile Tears plants are popular for their attractive foliage, which features thick, fleshy leaves with a rippled texture resembling the skin of a crocodile. They are native to tropical regions and prefer warm temperatures. These plants are relatively easy to care for and can thrive in both indoor and outdoor environments, making them a great addition to any plant collection.

# Fittonia albivenis - Forest Flame

## Water

Water the Forest Flame plant when the top inch of soil feels slightly dry. It prefers consistently moist soil, but avoid overwatering as it can lead to root rot. Ensure good drainage to prevent waterlogging. Mist the leaves occasionally to increase humidity, especially in drier indoor environments.

## Sun

The Forest Flame plant thrives in bright, indirect sunlight. It prefers moderate to high levels of light but should be protected from direct sunlight, which can scorch its delicate leaves. Place it near a window with filtered light or in a location with partial shade.

## Spray

Mist the leaves of the Forest Flame plant regularly to increase humidity and help prevent them from drying out. This is especially beneficial in dry indoor environments or during periods of low humidity.

## Prune

Pruning the Forest Flame plant is primarily done for maintenance or to control its size and shape. You can pinch back the stems to encourage bushier growth. Prune any leggy or damaged stems to maintain a compact and attractive appearance.

## Food

Feed the Forest Flame plant every 2-4 weeks during the growing season (spring and summer) with a balanced liquid fertilizer specifically formulated for houseplants. Dilute the fertilizer according to the package instructions. During the dormant period (fall and winter), reduce or suspend fertilization.

## Propagation

The Forest Flame plant can be propagated through stem cuttings. Take a healthy stem cutting just below a node, remove the lower leaves, and place it in a container with moist, well-draining soil or in water. Keep the cutting in a warm and humid environment until roots develop, then transplant it into a new pot.

## Safety

The Forest Flame plant is generally non-toxic to humans and pets. However, ingesting large quantities may cause mild stomach discomfort. It is always best to keep any plant out of reach of children and pets.

## Common Problems

Overwatering can lead to root rot, so ensure the soil has good drainage and avoid keeping the plant in standing water. The Forest Flame plant is prone to leaf drop in dry or low humidity conditions, so maintaining adequate moisture levels is important. Watch for pests such as spider mites and aphids, and take appropriate measures if an infestation occurs.

## Misc

The Forest Flame plant is known for its striking foliage, with vibrant green leaves adorned with contrasting veins of pink, red, or white. It is native to tropical rainforests and thrives in warm and humid conditions. Regularly misting the plant and providing it with a well-regulated environment can help ensure its health and vibrancy.

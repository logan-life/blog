# Ficus benjamina - Weeping Fig

## Water

Water the Ficus benjamina plant when the top inch of soil feels dry. Provide moderate watering, allowing the soil to partially dry out between waterings. Avoid overwatering, as it can lead to root rot. During the winter months or in lower light conditions, reduce watering frequency, allowing the soil to dry out more before watering again.

## Sun

Ficus benjamina plants prefer bright, indirect sunlight. Place them in a location with filtered or indirect light, away from direct sunlight. They can tolerate some shade but require sufficient light for healthy growth. Too much direct sunlight can scorch the leaves, while too little light can result in leggy growth and leaf drop.

## Soil

Plant Ficus benjamina in well-draining soil. Use a high-quality potting mix that retains some moisture but allows excess water to drain away. A soil pH of 6.0 to 7.5 is suitable. Avoid heavy or compacted soils, as they can hinder root development and lead to waterlogging.

## Fertilizer

Feed Ficus benjamina with a balanced, water-soluble fertilizer diluted to half the recommended strength. Apply the fertilizer every 2-4 weeks during the active growing season (spring and summer). Reduce or stop fertilizing during the winter months or when the plant is in a period of dormancy. Avoid over-fertilization, as it can lead to salt buildup and damage the plant.

## Pruning

Prune Ficus benjamina as needed to control its size and shape. Remove any dead, diseased, or damaged foliage using clean pruning shears. You can also trim back overgrown branches to maintain a more compact form. Pruning can be done throughout the year, but it is best to avoid heavy pruning during the winter months.

## Propagation

Ficus benjamina can be propagated through stem cuttings. Take a 6-8 inch cutting from a healthy, mature branch with at least two sets of leaves. Remove the lower leaves, dip the cut end in a rooting hormone (optional), and plant it in a well-draining rooting medium. Keep the soil consistently moist and provide warm temperatures for successful root development.

## Safety

Ficus benjamina is toxic to pets, including cats and dogs, if ingested. Keep the plant out of their reach to prevent any accidental ingestion. It can also cause skin irritation in some individuals, so it's advisable to wear gloves while handling the plant.

## Common Problems

Ficus benjamina is susceptible to pests such as spider mites, mealybugs, and scale insects. Regularly inspect the plant for any signs of infestation, including webbing, sticky residue, or small crawling insects. Treat any infestations promptly with appropriate insecticides or by wiping the leaves with a mild soapy solution.

## Misc

Ficus benjamina, also known as the Weeping Fig, is a popular houseplant with its graceful, drooping branches and glossy, dark green leaves. It can add a touch of elegance to any indoor space. Ficus benjamina is native to tropical regions and appreciates warm and humid conditions. It is important to provide consistent care, including proper watering, lighting, and occasional pruning, to keep the plant healthy and thriving.

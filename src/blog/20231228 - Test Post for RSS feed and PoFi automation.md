<!-- excerpt -->

This is the body of the test post.

I want to check how Slack handles truncating the post, so here's like 10 paragraphs of lorem ipsum inspired by The Expanse books by James S.A. Corey:

Ganymede station hung in the void, a belter's haven nestled between the gravitational ballet of Jupiter and its Trojan asteroids. Rocinante, the sleek Martian-built frigate, sliced through the black, navigating the intricate dance of the Belt. The protomolecule, a mysterious entity beyond human comprehension, cast its shadow across the planets and moons.

Belters toiled in the dark expanse, extracting precious resources from Ceres to Eros. The Canterbury, a battered ice hauler, bore witness to the delicate balance between Earthers, Martians, and the Belt. In the churn of the OPA's struggle for recognition, whispers of a new alien threat echoed through the corridors of Tycho Station.

The protomolecule's tendrils reached across the void, connecting the disparate corners of the solar system. The Nauvoo, repurposed into a generation ship, held the dreams of humanity within its colossal frame. Holden, the reluctant hero, grappled with the consequences of a discovery that transcended the limits of human understanding.

The Churn, that unforgiving force that swept through the Belt like a relentless storm, shaped the destinies of Belters like Naomi Nagata and Drummer. The rings, gateways to distant star systems, opened possibilities beyond the dreams of even the most ambitious Belt leaders.

Earth, a fading blue jewel in the cosmic sea, struggled with the political machinations of Avasarala and the rising tensions with Mars. The protomolecule's relentless evolution mirrored the inexorable march of time and the irrevocable changes it wrought upon the galaxy.

Bobbie Draper, a Martian marine with a haunted past, found herself entangled in a web of conspiracies that spanned the solar system. Belters, ever defiant, clung to the hope of a future unshackled from the oppressive gravity well of Earth.

In the void of the Slow Zone, where the laws of physics themselves seemed to rebel, the crew of the Rocinante faced the unknown. The Ring space, a cosmic gatekeeper, held the secrets of a civilization that predates humanity's first steps into the stars.

Fred Johnson, the former butcher of Anderson Station turned Belter leader, sought redemption in the whispers of the alien entities that lurked within the Ring space. The Investigator, a ghostly manifestation of Miller's consciousness, probed the depths of the protomolecule's intentions.

As the war drums echoed between Earth and Mars, the Free Navy, led by the charismatic but ruthless Marco Inaros, aimed to reshape the power dynamics of the solar system. Belters yearned for a voice in the grand opera of humanity's future.

The Expanse, a tale of political intrigue, interstellar mystery, and the indomitable spirit of those who dared to defy the gravity of their circumstances. In the ink-black canvas of space, the words of James SA Corey echoed, telling a story that transcended the limits of our own celestial cradle.

# Schefflera arboricola - Dwarf Umbrella Tree

## Water

Water Schefflera arboricola thoroughly when the top inch of soil feels dry. Allow the excess water to drain out from the bottom of the pot. Avoid overwatering, as it can lead to root rot. During the winter months, reduce watering frequency, allowing the soil to dry out slightly between waterings.

## Sun

Schefflera arboricola thrives in bright, indirect sunlight. Place it in a location with filtered light or partial shade. Direct sunlight can scorch the leaves, while insufficient light can result in leggy growth and reduced foliage. Find a spot with bright, indirect light for optimal growth.

## Humidity

Schefflera arboricola prefers moderate to high humidity levels. You can increase humidity by placing the plant on a tray filled with pebbles and water. Misting the foliage regularly can also help create a humid environment. However, it can tolerate average indoor humidity levels.

## Temperature

Schefflera arboricola prefers temperatures between 60째F (15째C) and 75째F (24째C). Avoid exposing the plant to cold drafts or extreme temperature fluctuations. It can tolerate slightly cooler temperatures during the winter months but should be kept away from cold windows or doors.

## Soil

Plant Schefflera arboricola in well-draining soil that retains some moisture. A mixture of peat moss, perlite, and regular potting soil is suitable. Ensure the soil is loose and well-aerated to prevent waterlogging. Maintain a slightly acidic to neutral pH for optimal growth.

## Fertilizer

Feed Schefflera arboricola with a balanced, water-soluble fertilizer during the growing season (spring and summer). Dilute the fertilizer to half the recommended strength and apply it every 2-4 weeks. Reduce or stop fertilizing during the winter months when the plant enters a period of dormancy.

## Pruning

Prune Schefflera arboricola as needed to maintain its desired shape and size. Remove any dead, damaged, or yellowing leaves by cutting them close to the stem. You can also trim back leggy growth to encourage bushier growth. Pruning can be done throughout the year.

## Propagation

Schefflera arboricola can be propagated through stem cuttings. Take 4-6 inch (10-15 cm) cuttings from healthy stems, ensuring they have at least a couple of leaves. Remove the lower leaves and place the cuttings in a well-draining potting mix. Keep the soil slightly moist until new roots develop.

## Safety

Schefflera arboricola is toxic to humans and pets if ingested. Keep it out of reach of children and pets. The sap of the plant can also cause skin irritation or allergic reactions in some individuals. Wear gloves when handling the plant and wash your hands thoroughly afterward.

## Common Problems

Schefflera arboricola can be susceptible to mealybugs, spider mites, and scale insects. Inspect the plant regularly for signs of infestation, such as webbing, sticky residue, or visible pests. Treat any pest issues promptly with appropriate insecticides or by using natural pest control methods.

## Misc

Schefflera arboricola, also known as Dwarf Umbrella Tree, is a popular houseplant known for its glossy, palmate leaves and attractive foliage. It is relatively easy to care for and can thrive in indoor environments. With proper care, Schefflera arboricola can add a touch of greenery and beauty to your home or office space.

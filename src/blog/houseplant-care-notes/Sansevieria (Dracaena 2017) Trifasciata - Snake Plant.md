# Sansevieria (Dracaena 2017) Trifasciata - Snake Plant

## Water

Water sparingly when the soil is dry. Snake plants are drought-tolerant and can withstand periods of neglect. Allow the soil to dry out between waterings, and avoid overwatering, as excessive moisture can lead to root rot.

### Sun

Snake plants can tolerate a wide range of lighting conditions, from bright indirect sunlight to low light. They are adaptable and can thrive in various lighting environments, but they prefer bright, indirect light. Avoid exposing them to direct sunlight for extended periods, as it can scorch the leaves.

### Spray

Snake plants do not require regular spraying. They have thick leaves that can retain moisture. However, occasionally wiping the leaves with a damp cloth can help keep them clean and free from dust.

### Prune

Pruning snake plants is typically not necessary. However, you can remove any yellow or damaged leaves by cutting them at the base. Pruning can be done at any time of the year when needed.

### Food

Snake plants are relatively low-maintenance and do not require frequent fertilization. You can apply a balanced houseplant fertilizer once or twice a year during the growing season (spring and summer) if desired. Dilute the fertilizer to half or quarter strength as directed on the package.

### Propagation

Snake plants can be propagated through division or leaf cuttings. For division, carefully separate the rhizomes and plant them in separate pots. Leaf cuttings can be taken by cutting a healthy leaf into several sections and planting them in well-draining soil. Provide warmth and indirect light during the propagation process.

### Safety

Snake plants are generally considered safe and non-toxic to humans and pets. However, ingestion may still cause mild stomach discomfort. It is always best to keep any plant out of reach of children and pets.

### Common Problems

Overwatering is the most common issue with snake plants, leading to root rot. Ensure the soil has proper drainage and allow it to dry out between waterings. Inadequate lighting can cause slow growth or pale leaves. Pests such as mealybugs or spider mites can occasionally infest snake plants, so inspect regularly and treat as necessary.

### Misc

Snake plants are known for their air-purifying properties, as they can help remove toxins from the air. They are resilient and can tolerate neglect, making them suitable for beginners or those with a busy lifestyle. Snake plants are native to tropical regions and can be grown both indoors and outdoors in mild climates.

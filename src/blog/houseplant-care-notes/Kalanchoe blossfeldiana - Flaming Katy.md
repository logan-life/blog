# Kalanchoe blossfeldiana - Flaming Katy

## Water

Water Kalanchoe blossfeldiana moderately, allowing the top inch of soil to dry out between waterings. Avoid overwatering, as it can lead to root rot. It is better to underwater than overwater this plant. During the active growing season, provide slightly more frequent watering, and reduce watering during the winter or dormancy period.

## Sun

Kalanchoe blossfeldiana prefers bright, indirect sunlight. Place it in a location with filtered light or partial shade. It can tolerate some direct sunlight, but intense or prolonged exposure to direct sun may scorch the leaves. Insufficient light can result in leggy growth and fewer flowers.

## Soil

Plant Kalanchoe blossfeldiana in well-draining soil. A commercial succulent or cactus potting mix is suitable. Ensure the soil has good drainage to prevent waterlogged conditions. Avoid heavy or compacted soils, as they can retain too much moisture and cause root problems.

## Fertilizer

Feed Kalanchoe blossfeldiana with a balanced, water-soluble fertilizer diluted to half the recommended strength. Apply the fertilizer every 2-4 weeks during the active growing season (spring and summer). Reduce or stop fertilizing during the winter months or when the plant is in a period of dormancy. Overfertilization can lead to salt buildup and damage the plant.

## Pruning

Prune Kalanchoe blossfeldiana as needed to remove spent flowers or leggy growth. Pinch back the stems to encourage bushier growth and more abundant flower production. Regular pruning also helps maintain a compact and attractive plant shape. Avoid heavy pruning during the winter months when the plant is resting.

## Propagation

Kalanchoe blossfeldiana can be propagated from stem cuttings. Take 3-4 inch cuttings from healthy stems, remove the lower leaves, and allow the cut ends to callus for a day or two. Plant the cuttings in a well-draining potting mix, keep them slightly moist, and provide bright, indirect light. The cuttings should root within a few weeks.

## Safety

Kalanchoe blossfeldiana contains toxic compounds that can be harmful if ingested. Keep the plant out of reach of children and pets. If accidentally ingested, seek medical attention. It is also advisable to wear gloves while handling the plant to avoid any skin irritation.

## Common Problems

Kalanchoe blossfeldiana is generally a hardy plant, but it can be susceptible to pests such as aphids, mealybugs, and spider mites. Regularly inspect the plant for signs of infestation and take appropriate measures, such as using insecticidal soap or neem oil, to control the pests. Overwatering can also lead to root rot, so ensure proper watering practices.

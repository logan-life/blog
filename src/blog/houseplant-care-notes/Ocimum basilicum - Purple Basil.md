# Ocimum basilicum - Purple Basil

## Water

Water Purple Basil thoroughly when the top inch of soil feels dry. Provide regular watering to keep the soil evenly moist, but avoid waterlogging or allowing the plant to sit in standing water. During hot and dry periods, you may need to increase watering frequency. Ensure good drainage to prevent root rot.

## Sun

Purple Basil plants require ample sunlight to thrive. Place them in a location that receives at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight each day. If growing indoors, provide them with bright, indirect light or use grow lights to supplement the natural light. Insufficient sunlight can result in leggy growth and reduced color intensity.

## Soil

Plant Purple Basil in well-draining soil that is rich in organic matter. A soil pH of 6.0 to 7.5 is ideal. You can amend the soil with compost or well-rotted manure to improve its fertility and drainage. Ensure the soil is loose and well-aerated for optimal root development.

## Fertilizer

Feed Purple Basil with a balanced, water-soluble fertilizer every 2-3 weeks during the active growing season (spring and summer). Use a fertilizer specifically formulated for herbs or vegetables. Follow the package instructions for the correct dosage. Avoid over-fertilization, as it can lead to excessive foliage growth with diminished flavor.

## Pruning

Regular pruning is beneficial for Purple Basil to promote bushier growth and prevent flowering. Pinch off the top pair of leaves on each stem to encourage branching. Harvest leaves frequently to maintain a compact and healthy plant. Pruning should be done throughout the growing season.

## Harvesting

Harvest Purple Basil leaves once the plant has developed enough foliage. You can begin harvesting when the plant is about 6 inches tall. Take care not to remove more than one-third of the plant at a time. Harvest leaves from the top, just above a pair of leaves or branching point.

## Pests and Diseases

Purple Basil can be susceptible to pests such as aphids, whiteflies, and spider mites. Regularly inspect the plant for any signs of infestation and take appropriate measures, such as using insecticidal soap or neem oil, to control the pests. Ensure good air circulation around the plant to prevent fungal diseases.

## Companion Plants

Purple Basil benefits from being planted alongside certain companion plants, such as tomatoes, peppers, and marigolds. These plants can help repel pests and enhance the growth and flavor of the basil. However, avoid planting Purple Basil near other herbs such as rue or sage, as they may inhibit its growth.

## Misc

Purple Basil is a variant of Sweet Basil (Ocimum basilicum) and is known for its striking purple-colored leaves. It has a similar flavor and culinary uses as Sweet Basil, adding a unique visual and aromatic element to dishes. Purple Basil can be used in salads, pestos, sauces, and other culinary creations. Like other basil varieties, it is an annual plant that is relatively easy to grow and can be enjoyed in both indoor and outdoor gardens.

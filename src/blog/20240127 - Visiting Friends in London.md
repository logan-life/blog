title: Visiting Friends in London
category: "leisure"
excerpt: "In January of 2024, Jordan and I took the Eurostar to meet up with some dear friends for a long weekend in the SoHo area of Central London. We visited museums, ate a ton of great food, walked around a bunch, visited Ted Lasso's Richmond neighborhood, and generally had a wonderful time. Here are some pics and thoughts and links to a lot of art stuff."

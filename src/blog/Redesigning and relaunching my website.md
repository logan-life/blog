Yep, this is a blog launch announcement. And yep, it is 2023 and the blog-as-format is pretty dead. But I want a place to share what I'm working on, and endless scroll social media platforms do not spark joy. So here we are!
<!-- excerpt -->

The primary purpose of my website has been to showcase my projects and CV to potential employers. This was critical when I was switching careers from restaurants to tech in the middle of a pandemic. I wanted to make sure that I was putting my best foot forward.

Fast-forward two years and I'm working in tech at a finance company in the Netherlands. I cleared the hurdle of getting my foot in the door in the tech industry. Now I have the luxury of treating my website as a personal project rather than only professional one.

On this reworked version of my website, I'll be:

- Writing short TILs (Today I Learned) about things I've learned in my day-to-day work
- Writing longer blog posts about projects I'm working on, life events, and so on.
- Sharing completed projects - and I have some great ones in the pipeline!

I'm glad to have a place to share my thoughts and projects, and I hope you enjoy reading them. You can keep up with me by bookmarking this site, subscribing to the [RSS feed](https://www.loganayliffe.com/rss.xml), or following me on [Mastodon](https://hachyderm.io/@logan).
